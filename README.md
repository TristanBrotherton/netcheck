# Netcheck
A shellscript to check and log when your internet connection goes down. Netcheck checks for internet connectivity
and if its interupted, writes a log containing the time of disconnect, and length of time disconnected.
Once it reconnects it will log the reconnected internet speed and continue monitoring again.

Netcheck also include an optional web interface for viewing your connection logs remotely from a web browser.
You can use a service such as NGROK to allow you to see the web interface outside of your network.

## Run as a service
You can optionally run netcheck as a system service. For systems that use 
systemctl (Linux) you may use its service installation script:

    sudo ./netcheck.sh -i

## Scripts for disconnect/reconnect events
You can optionally define actions to be executed upon disconnect or reconnect.
To do so you may use the `-d` and `-r` options. 

Two sample `bash` scripts making use of the `espeak-ng` text-to-speech utility are provided
under the `sample-scripts` to showcase how these options can be used:

    ./netcheck.sh -d sample-scripts/disconnected.sh -r sample-scripts/reconnected.sh

## Script to display link down events
A github-like activity chart displaying link down events can be displayed with:

    ./internet_status_chart.sh

To load custom log file use the -f option:

    ./internet_status_chart.sh -f path/my_log_file.log
